*How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Using Chrome's DevTools inspector helps format or position elements by allowing users to manipulate styles right on the page in real-time using checkboxes to apply styling, or writing new styles altogether. This is efficient because with quick previews of what happens to elements when certain styles are applied, it's hopefully easier to understand and apply the lessons learned from the real-time preview to code being edited locally.


*How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

Manipulating height and width using CSS will resize an element in the DOM. 


*What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Of all the CSS concepts explored so far, learning to position elements was the toughest for me to wrap my head around. The two I found easiest to understand were static and fixed positions. A static element can be understood as an element that has not been specifically positioned, and will therefore appear on the page wherever the programmer decides to place the element. Setting elements with a fixed position is akin to "affixing" the element in place regardless of how a user navigates the page. So if a programmer wants a sidebar to follow a user as they scroll down a page, the developer sets the sidebar with a fixed position.      

Understanding relative and absolute positions is more difficult and I still struggle with this at times. Setting an element to relative and manipulating its top, left, right, or bottom will move the element relative to its normal position in the DOM. An element set to position: absolute will be positioned according to the bounds of its parent element.


*What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

A margin is the space that surrounds an element, the border contains the element, and padding is space between the element and the border. Adding padding to an element will increase the space between the element and the border.


*What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I liked this assignment because it exposed me to the wonders of Chrome's DevTools. I like the immediacy of seeing the changes take effect, and that changing CSS styling using dev tools is a very low commitment--just refresh the page if you want to undo what's been done!
