  Being a relative newcomer to the concept of version control can be rather intimidating. A good bit of initial setup, plenty of new commands and concepts to know and use, and multiple working versions of projects. It's a lot to take in. However, once you get past the not-so-steep learning curve things start to make more sense. But before we get into that, a question: why version control in the first place?
  </p>
  <p>
  Version control helps you keep track of what's going on in your project and is even more helpful when working on teams with multiple people. Any number of people can be working on any number of versions of the same project simultaneously without stepping on anyone else's toes. All of these versions can then be peer reviewed and the improvements can then be implemented to the main project. It allows for multiple revisions which can all be documented and commented upon for future review. Most importantly, it allows you to revert back to a previous version if something happens to the current working version (i.e. bugs in your code, etc.)
  </p>
  <p>
  There are many tools out there to help you implement version control for your projects. One of the most popular is Git, which is open source. Git operates from your commmand line, which is where any good web developer does most of their work (right, guys?) Git allows you to create and work on multiple branches where you can create and alter new work and test it before applying it back to the master branch. This prevents you from making potentially dangerous errors which could be a detriment to your project.

  While Git is ran locally on your computer, it also interfaces with GitHub. GitHub is a website which allows for remote storage of projects so that anyone anywhere can gain access to your projects for collaboration. This is part of the beauty of version control

  <p>Version control is an important concept for programmers. When editing a file, a programmer can use git to track the changes made since they last saved or 'committed' the file to their repository. Each commit creates a new version of the file so that the programmer can continue to edit the original file, but have previous versions of the file to which they can revert if necessary. Committing a file with a commit message describes the changes made to the file so that anyone browsing through a directory of the files knows the changes that have been made and which version of the file does what. GitHub is a great place to store code, especially when multiple programmers want to collaborate on a project. Storing your code in a (public) repo on GitHub gives anyone access to the source code files and streamlines the collaboration process between programmers.</p>

-What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

We used the <section> tag often because it's better than using <div> tags to organize the document. It makes more sense semantically and for this challenge it was useful to give our sections ids to better identify elements within the document. 


-How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

When my partner and I opened our file in a browser window, we were able to see that the browser more or less interprets HTML by the order in which it is written. Top to bottom. 


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I LOVED learning about snippets and shortcuts in Sublime! I'm already brainstorming some helpful snippets to create, such as creating snippets to insert <nav> templates or to insert <ul> templates. I found some documentation about other Sublime keyboard shortcuts (http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_osx.html) and there are many. I already use command + F to find, command + x to delete, and command + z to undo. As I use Sublime more and more, I'm sure I'll be able to identify the more useful commands and start using them more.
