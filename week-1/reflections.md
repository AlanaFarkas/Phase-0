#1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Time management has not been a major consideration in my daily life for quite a while. It has been approximately five and half years between finishing college and being accepted into Dev Bootcamp and in that time I have not had to work hard managing my time at all. Because my career up until this point has left me cold, I’ve really just put in the 40 hours a week required of me during normal business hours, leaving the remaining time in the week open. My family lives in the metro region, I live with my boyfriend, and my friends are nearby, meaning that if I have plans to do something after work or on weekends, it isn’t too taxing to schedule and arrange. After being accepted into Dev Bootcamp, I found myself most anxious about time management because I’ve been out of practice for so long. When I say time management, I think what I really mean is that I’m anxious about self-discipline.

For this challenge I opened all the links and read through most everything. “Time Boxing” was not a concept I was previously familiar with, but ‘time boxing’ or the ‘pomodoro technique’ is something I found most interesting. I think that blocking out 25 minutes of time to work, then giving myself a 5 minute break, will help me build great work habits without overwhelming myself with unrealistic expectations. Can I work for say, 2 hours without taking a break and expect to stay 100% focused the whole time? Knowing myself, I would say ‘no way’. If I expected that, I would be setting myself up to fail and I tend to beat myself up when I perceive that I’ve ‘failed’, so by using time management tools like the pomodoro technique will help me build tiny habits, and set myself up to win! Although the little tomato timer used in the video was cute, my phone will be my timer and it’s doing a great job--I’ve already started time boxing! By working hard in 25 minute intervals, I hope it becomes a ‘tiny habit’ that will allow me to continue to grow, working for longer stretches without needing breaks.

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell allows access to a computer’s operating system using a command line interface (CLI), instead of a graphic user interface(GUI). A shell allows users to navigate and manipulate computer files, folders, etc., using keyboard commands. Bash is the language that a shell interprets so that a user can direct a computer’s system using specific keyboard commands.

I have completed the exercises from the Command Line Crash Course and was able to use all the commands successfully, however I stumbled a bit during the lessons on Pipes and Redirection, and Moving Around (pushd/popd). I followed the instructions and saw the results in the shell for these exercises, but it didn’t really ‘click’ for me until I looked at my shell processes next to the same processes on my GUI. I think I need to work on training my brain to “see” things in the CLI the same way I can using the GUI. Going through the exercises I found myself most often using “cd”, “ls”, and “pwd” which, at this point in my studies were definitely most important because they helped me navigate through the files, and remind me where I was when I felt lost. Going forward I suspect “mkdir”, “cp”, “popd”, “pushd”, “grep” and “find” will be the most important commands.

-pwd: print working directory
-ls: list files or directory
-mv: move files or directory
-cd: change directory
-../: move ‘back’ one directory
-touch: creates a new file
-mkdir: creates new directory
-less: pages through files
-rmdir: remove directory
-rm: remove files
-help: prints a list of commands to the screen

I know this seems copied/pasted but these are off the top of my head. Those flashcards paid off!
