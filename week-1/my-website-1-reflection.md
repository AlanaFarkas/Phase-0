-Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a new repository, navigate to your GitHub profile and find the ‘+’ icon. Clicking the icon gives you two choices and you should choose ‘new repository’ from the drop down menu. The next screen will ask you to give your repository a name and some other settings. When you are satisfied, click “create repository” and on the next page you will be ‘inside’ your new repository where the coding files for this particular project should live. To ‘clone’ the files from the online repository (GitHub) to your local repostiory (your computer), find the URL written in the HTTPS field in your GitHub repository. Then in your CLI, naviagate to the desired directory and type ‘git clone [URL]’. This will add the project’s files from the GitHub to your the computer. 



-Describe what open source means.
Using open source to describe a program means that other programmers can access, use, and manipulate the source files without needing permission from the source codes' author. 

-What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I had known about open source before DBC, but never gave it much thought as I didn't then consider myself a developer or even a developer-in-training. Now having read a bit about it, open source indeed does sound like utopia! It seems that everyone can benefit from open source projects because of the endless programming possibilities that come from unfettered collaboration.

-Assess the importance of using licenses.
No matter how source code is used or changed by other programmers, licenses protect the project's original creator so that the creator is always given credit for the original work.


-What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I was able to (sloppily) complete the previous assignment 1.5 but with a very hazy understanding of the git workflow process, so I was nervous to keep going forward with the exercises. Branches, pushing, pulling, and committing were all jumbled in my head. As I got started with the 1.6 assigment, I re-watched segments of the 'pull request workflow' found in assignment 1.5 several times while working through each task required for assigment 1.6. Watching segments of the video while simultaneously doing the work for 1.6 REALLY helped understand each step in the process and produced an audible and even visible "AHA!!" For assignment 1.5 I had watched the video, but it didn't have as hard of an impact until I combined watching the video with doing the work for 1.6
