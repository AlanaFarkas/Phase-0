**Release 1**

```ruby
Hours in a year
p 24*365
```

```ruby
Minutes in a decade
p ((60*24)*365)*10
```

*What does puts do?
Puts stands for "puts string". Puts prints a value to the concole but returns nil with a new line.

*What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is number without a decimal point, while a float is a number with decimal points.

*What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Dividing two integers will return an integer. If the two integers cannot be divided equally, the return value will be rounded down to the nearest integer. Dividing two floats will return a float.

**Release 7 Reflection**

*How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby handles basic arithmetic in much the same way as a calculator using the same symbols (+, -, *, /).

*What is the difference between integers and floats?
Integers are numbers without decimal points, and floats are numbers with decimal points.

*What is the difference between integer and float division?
Dividing two integers will return an integer. If the two numbers cannot be divided equally, the return value will be rounded down to the nearest integer. Dividing two floats will return a float.

*What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are anything wrapped in quotation marks. You can assign variable names to strings, for example, I can assign var my_name = "Alana Farkas" to return Alana Farkas.

*What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variables are used to assign return values. You assign local variables to values that may change.

*How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
Yes, good review for a rusty ruby brain. Learning Rspec will be interesting.
