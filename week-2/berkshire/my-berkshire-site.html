- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	This was my first pair and I had so much fun. It was exciting to hit "run" While my pair and I were using jsfiddle but as we were wrapping up I opened the file in my browser and was filled with joy at seeing the site! It's an ugly site but it's thrilling to know I built it.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	My pair and I talked about which elements we would use to build our site (ex. <div> vs. <section>) before we started writing code which was a great way to start. We researched how to make ampersands and how to create the visible line between the header and unordered list. I think being puzzled together and finding the answer together was a nice bonding experience.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	My pair and I stuck to best practices and we did not stray from the instructions. Before my pair and I started coding, we discussed each element we would use to build each part of the site and that was helpful in making sure we were on the same page. 

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	HTML is good for visualizing the structure of a page or site. Coming from an architectural background, I like it's 'blueprint-like' qualities. It's bad in that it should not be used for any formatting or styling. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	One trick I use is that I always write the closing tag immediately after my opening tag so I don't forget.
