-What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal is to introduce myself and my work to a wide audience. It will feature an "about me" section, a blog, a section with examples of projects I've worked on, and a contact page with information about getting in touch or hiring me.

-What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is a potential employer. Through my site, I want to display the work I've done so that future employees can see my skills, but also get insight into my personality through the "about me" section and my blog. 

-What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

Primarily, I want users to see examples of my work, know how to contact/hire me, and get to know me through the "about me" and blog pages.

-What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

UX and design are important because they takes into account the end user's feelings on their experience using a site. UX does not directly deal with programming, but informs the site's design based on a variety of user testing methods. A site can be written in good, clean code and be easy to use, however if a user doesn't have a good experience using the site, fewer people will use the site, making it useless. 

-What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience is the study of how a user feels while using the site. User experience design is design based on user experience data. Ex. do users prefer square buttons or round buttons, and why? The answer to that question informs the design of a site. UX is subjective and at times, extremely nuanced, but ultimately very valuable in determining if a site's purpose--step #1 in the phases of web design--is being met. 

-Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

At first I tried to use the wireframing sites suggested like WriteMaps and Slickplan but in the end, drawing a picture with pen and paper was the simplest and most efficient way to complete my site map.
