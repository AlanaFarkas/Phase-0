-What is a wireframe?
Wireframing is a a blueprint for how a site should look, that is created before the site is coded, akin to drawing up architectural blueprints before construction begins.

-What are the benefits of wireframing?
A wireframe allows the designer, developer, and client to understand how the site will look and function so that any problems with the design can be solved before writing any code. Changing design and functionality on paper or a wireframing tool is easier, cheaper, and more efficient than having to re-write code once it's been written.  

-Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I didn't really enjoy it as I don't consider myself a visually creative person. I used Mockingbird to create my wireframe and while it was easy to use, I found it tedious to position all my elements using my computer's trackpad. I prefer using pen and paper but I'm happy to learn to use new tools, especially since I'll probably need to use similar tools on the job soon.

-Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
The initial vision for my wireframe in my head is more or less how it appears on my wireframes with some slight tweaks to the blog layout when I read that we'd eventually have 7 posts. I added 7 blog post elements. 

-What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I didn't have any quesitons about the challenge but I enjoyed comparing the different wireframing tools to see which one appealed to me most. I finally settled on Mockingbird and liked it well enough but will need to experiment with other sites, too. 

-Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoy information architecture and thinking about how a site is navigated, but laying out the elements of my wireframe got a bit boring.
